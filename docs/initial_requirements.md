# Initial Design Requirements/Needs

## Business Rules

- Need to set this website/service apart from any others - why would people choose to hire this company to build their site rather than using Squarespace or Wordpress?
  - The service is fully hosted and managed by the company, and personal customer support is offered through subscription that allows unlimited edits to the site - the customer will not have to host the site, manage resources, or personally make edits.
- The designs need to be neat, modern, and semi-original - what will set the websites that this company creates apart from others?
  - A customer's site will be designed and developed with state-of-the-art software, allowing them to keep up with modern design trends that will appeal to all potential customers.
- Define what the "can dos" and "cannot dos" of the company are - what are the nuances of the software and what are the limitations of what it can do?
  - The subscription service and site builds are priced affordably, making it an easier purchase for the customer.
  - E-commerce and data analytics solutions are possible as well, with more time being required for turnaround.
  - The main limitation is that there is only one developer currently, so turnaround times are not as efficient as a larger software company. However, this inconvenience is offset by the affordable pricing.
